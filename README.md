# ANLY590_Project

The objective is to use Neural Network models to do sentiment analysis on Quora insincere questions classification dataset. 

The datasets are in this google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ki2K7TlPEttBAQvDJP-PyIctumoQbL9V?usp=sharing

``train_orig.csv`` is the original dataset

``train.csv`` is the training set data

``test.csv`` is the test set data

``quora.300d.txt`` is the word2vec embedding model trained on the train_orig.csv using gensim

``Data_Cleaning_EDA.ipynb`` contains the code for data preprocessing and EDA

``CNN.ipynb`` contains the code for the CNN model

``LSTM.ipynb`` contains the code for the RNN model
